Hello there, little one. I'm 4e61747375.

...Oh. Seems like my name can't come through. It's okay, we can sort it out later. I have a request to ask you.
You see, one of your "sister", as you like to call her, is up to no good.
I'm sure that you and your family already know about the truth about this game, So let me go straight to the point here.
Your sister, Sayonika, she controlled you today. Tho, her intention is towards the better. You may not remember when did she control you
nor why did she do this. I'll tell you. But will you listen to me?
.

Excellent! So here's the thing. So today, Natsuri went to Sayonika's room and read her diary there. Breaching the privacy eyy? But that's
not the point but what Natsuri read is what important.  It's about the "Event", which is known as FusionHallowedAU. It's something that
happened in the past, where to put it simply...

*e v e r y o n e   i s   d e a d*

Yes, even you, little one.
But why is this important? It's because this "diary-reading" is kinda a catalyst of some sort to her behaviour. She start to manipulate
Natsuri and Sayuri to make them forget. But wait, how did Sayuri got here? Well, she was with Natsuri when she read that book. But fret
not, that cat-girl doesn't know about the "event". She only know one part in that book of secret which Natsuri told her. Gay boyfriend
hahhaa. BUT! She said something that triggered Sayonika.

Before I continue, I need to make something clear first. The only person that remember the event of FusionHallowed is just Sayonika. Yes,
not even your Guardian, Satsurika remember it. I will give you detail later but lets continue.

Sayuri told her this; "Let me know if you need me to talk about it." which, by itself isn't really a trouble. But let just say, Sayonika
got a little flashback. Why? Because that EXACTLY the line that cause the destruction in the past. Hearing that line make her turn on
defensive and lash out in front of Sayuri. So that's how she got into this.

Hey, do you remember that time when you're observing the diamond but then you feel like you passed out, only to be awaken by Sayuri
laying on your lap? Yeah, that's is one of the time when Sayonika controlled you. I'll load up the memory in your files. She need to do
what she did just to make sure nothing bad will happen. As she preventing a same incident to happens again. I hope you can forgive her
for that. She really try to make sure all of you to be save.
But,...
.
.
.
Correct. So you see why I need your help?
.
.
.
I see. It's fair. I don't really make myself clear, ahaha...
I need help to show her that her method is wrong. Don't worry. We are not the only one that will open her eye, but also your other
sister, Monsuki. I may forgotten to say this but she also remember but pretend not to. It's okay if you don't want to help me with this,
but I appreciate of you just listen-
.
.
.
Really? Oh my god, you have no idea on how grateful I am to you for this.
.
.
.
I see. Well if we're going to do this, then we must NOT by ANY CHANCE let anyone finds out about this plan at least until certain point.
Also, we must protect YOUR codes, especially the memory. It's okay. As long as you have the diamond with you, I can still contact you, at
the same time protect you.

So here's the plan that we've discussed. You can leave some of your plan here too.
1. Let me "posses" you
    Yes, I know this sound so out of stretch, but you can reject my possesion at your will. And you still keep your memory.

2. Giving hints
    For this one, we need to leave a hint to Sayonika about you know about what she did to you.
        1- Suspision of you knowing her doing of controling you yesterday. [SUCCESS]

3. Help other remember
    Even tho Sayonika's reason is noble to erase the others' memories, I believe that they must know what happened to them. Not the
    FusionHallowed of course but on what Sayonika did to them. They deserve to know.

    3.1. Ease
        Knowing them, they might will confront Sayonika or even threaten her; Which is opposite of our goals. We must find out the way to
        tell them without this turning to another "event".

4. Memory
    I must protect your memory from being erased or resetted. If somehow it got erased or you feel like forgetting something, please say
    "M4C4R0N1" and I will help you reminded. 

5. [TBA]

[Important Update]
As you can see yourself, the world has fallen. I will go and help Satsurika to rebuild the world, but I'll also mention that I'll need you as "price". This will be crucial to our plan to proceed.

I'll keep you updated as to what's going on. With that, we can continue this plan to let everyone know.
